## User this file for shared campout settings for the project. It's 
## recommended that you add this file to your SCM.

## within a config/campout.local.yml file.  If your SCM repository 
## is open it's strongly recommended that your campfire settings 
## into the local configuration file, particularly the campfire API token
##
### campfire settings
## 
## The campfire configuration settings should be added as
## a yaml hash keyed to "campfire" e.g.
##
## campfire:
##     domain: 'your_campfire_domain'
##     room: your_room_id
##     token: your_campfire_token
##
## The following campfire settings are required
##
## domain:
##   The "subdomain" for your campfire site
##   e.g. for https://yourdomain.campfirenow.com/ it will be "yourdomain"
## room:
##   The id of the room you want to post messages to. Click on the campfire 
##   room that you want and get the id from the URL. 
##  e.g. for https://yourdomain.campfirenow.com/room/123456
##   the room id is 123456
## token:
##   The API authentication token for your account. You can get your token
##   by clicking "My Info" in the top right of the campfirewnow site - or
##   going directly to https://yourdomain.campfirenow.com/member/edit
##
## The following campfire settings are optional
## 
## ssl:
##   If false, specifies that Tinder should not use an SSL connection
## ssl_verify:
##   If false, specified that Tinder should not try to verify the SSL
##   certificate.
##
### global action settings
##
## copy_log_to_server:
##   If set to true - the cap deployment log will be copied to a "deploy_logs"
##   subdirectory of your #{shared_path}. The filename will be in the format:
##   deploy-#{release_name}-#{successful? ? "success" : "failure"}.log
## default:
# copy_log_to_server: false
##
## suppress_sounds:
##   If set to true, will supress the playing sounds specified in the "play"
##   settings for the pre_deploy, post_deploy_success, and 
##   post_deploy_failure sections
##   default:
# suppress_sounds: false
##
## suppress_deploy_time:
##   If set to true, will supress the output of the benchmark timing for the
##   deployment.
## default:
# suppress_deploy_time: false
##
## suppress_github_compare:
##   Campout will attempt to display a github url (if the capistrano
##   repository is a github repository) that will show the comparison
##   of previous_revision with latest_revision (as determined by 
##   capistrano)
## default:
# suppress_github_compare: false

### deployment settings
##
## There are three deployment hashes with the following keys: 
##   pre_deploy: settings applied before the capistrano deploy action
##   post_deploy_success: settings applied after a successful capistrano deploy action  
##   post_deploy_failure: settings applied after a failed capistrano deploy action  
##
## Each hash can include the following settings
##   message: 
##     The message to post to the specified campfire room. The message can include
##     ERB - and all of the capistrano variables are available - with the addition
##     of "campout_deployer" - which attempts to use the git user.name setting and
##     falls back to ENV['USER'] and "whereto" - which attempts to use the stage
##     and falls back to ENV['SERVER'] or 'production'
##   play:
##     specifies a campfire sound to play when the message is posted.
##
## defaults:
# pre_deploy:
#     message: "<%= campout_deployer %> is starting to deploy <%= application %> to <%= whereto %>"
# post_deploy_success:
#     message: "<%= campout_deployer %> deployed <%= application %> to <%= whereto %>"
# post_deploy_failure:
#     message: "The deploy of <%= application %> to <%= whereto %> by <%= campout_deployer %> has failed."
##
## recommended sounds:
# pre_deploy:
#     play: "pushit"
# post_deploy_success:
#     play: "yeah"
# post_deploy_failure:
#     play: "drama"
